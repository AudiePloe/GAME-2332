# Game Brainstorming

## Game Idea

A sort of camping or hiking simulation game that takes aspects of a survival game without it being so serious. There would still be dangers but not very fantasy or unreal ones.
the player will have to traval and navigate various paths and waypoints to complete each park or level.

## Scene

The game takes place in the national parks of the United States, not scanned per detail, but matching terrain and notable sights.

## Setting

The world is just like our own, nothing is changed.

## Character

The character is a determined camper or backpacker, their goal is to treck and camp in all parks at the most remote spots.

## Character Progression

The character will have to travel accross these landscapes, finding ways around obsticals and rough terrain. An other way the character progresses
is the accumilation of new skills and traits to better help their journeys.
