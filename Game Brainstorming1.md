# Game Brainstorming

## Game Idea

A sort of camping or hiking simulation game that takes aspects of a survival game without it being so serious. There would still be dangers but not very fantasy or unreal ones.
the player will have to traval and navigate various paths and waypoints to complete each park or level.

## Scene

The game takes place in the national parks of the United States, not scanned per detail, but matching terrain and notable sights. 
Each park already has its own notable features so each recreation would include those plus a semi prosedural enviroment that the player must traverse.

## Setting

The world is just like our own, nothing is changed other than the exact layout of these parks. Perhaps later in the game there could be parks 
in far off lands of remote countries or islands that are more challenging or dangerous.

## Character

The character is a determined camper or backpacker, their goal is to treck and camp in all parks at the most remote spots. 
Your character starts as a novice camper with basic and cheap gear, and can progress to become the greatest camper that has ever lived, 
using the most up to date and specialized gear.

## Character Progression

The character will have to travel accross these landscapes, finding ways around obsticals and rough terrain. An other way the character progresses
is the accumilation of new skills and traits to better help their journeys.
